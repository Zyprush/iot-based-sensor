## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Welcome to the repository for the DICT Region 4 Mamburao Office Webinar Certificate Generator project! This initiative was conceived and proposed by our talented interns, <a href="https://jakedenver.com" target="_blank"><b>Jake Denver Alberio</b></a> and Hanz Bausa, during their internship at the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Region 4 Mamburao Office.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to streamline and automate the process of generating and distributing certificates for all upcoming DICT webinars. In today's digital age, where remote engagements and online learning have become the norm, providing participants with timely and professionally crafted certificates is crucial. Jake and Hanz recognized this need and embarked on a mission to develop a user-friendly website that not only creates certificates but also automatically dispatches them via email.

Contributions
We encourage contributions from the open-source community to enhance and improve this certificate generator. Feel free to fork this repository, make your modifications, and submit pull requests. Together, let's make the DICT Region 4 Mamburao Office Webinar Certificate Generator an efficient and reliable tool for webinar certification.

Thank you for your interest and support in advancing digital solutions for the Department of Information and Communications Technology!
